# LiveBall-Speed-and-Trajectory

LiveBall Speed and Trajectory is a computer vision-based project that uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect a cricket ball in a video, track its motion, and estimate its speed and trajectory using real-world calibration.

Model
This project uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model (CBDbest.pt) trained specifically on cricket ball data from this repo:
ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/HarshSingh18/CV_Project/tree/main


Requirements
Install all dependencies from requirements.txt:

b
pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and OpenCV-compatible FFMPEG codecs installed.

Features
Detects a cricket ball in each frame using YOLOv8

Tracks the ballâ€™s motion over time

Calculates ball speed using pixel-to-meter calibration

Draws the trajectory and bounding boxes in real-time

Overlays the final speed on the last frame

Outputs a new video (output.avi) with full annotations

Logs all frame-wise ball speeds to the terminal

1. Pixel Calibration
   
Use pix.py to manually select two points (typically the crease lines on a cricket pitch) and compute the pixel distance corresponding to the real-world pitch length (20.12 meters).

python pix.py


This gives you a scale:
meters_per_pixel = 20.12 / pixel_distance

2. Ball Tracking & Speed Estimation
Run the main script on your input video. It uses the YOLO model (CBDbest.pt) to detect the ball, track its path, and compute its speed.

python track\&speed.py

This will:

Detect the cricket ball in each frame.

Draw its trajectory.

Estimate the speed using frame-to-frame movement.

Save the annotated video as output.avi inside the root directory.

Show final ball speed in a black frame for 3 seconds at the end of the video.

Print all tracked speeds in the terminal.

Output
Annotated Video: Trajectory path and bounding boxes around the ball.

Speed Overlay: Real-time speed display on each frame.

Final Speed Summary: Displayed at the end of video and logged in terminal.



Notes
The system assumes the ball is visible for at least a few consecutive frames.

Speeds >200 km/h are filtered as noise.

Output video is always saved in .avi format regardless of input format (.mp4, .mkv, etc.).
